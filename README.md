# self_trained_detector
Self-trained detection detectors are implemented on small-scale Radar and Sonar detection datasets.

The above codes is implemented with [mmdetection2.0](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection).

The SSDD dataset used in this paper could be downloaded at [this page](https://pan.baidu.com/share/init?surl=bkg0jd0H9tV8w25gRO1c6A) (extraction code is "fyh0").

The SCTD dataset constructed in this paper could be downloaded in the [repository created by Dr Mingqiang Ning](https://github.com/freepoet/SCTD)
