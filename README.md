# self_trained_detector
Self-trained detection detectors are implemented on small-scale Radar and Sonar detection datasets.

The above codes is implemented with [mmdetection2.0](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection).

The SSDD dataset used in this paper could be downloaded at this page.

The SCTD dataset constructed in this paper could be downloaded in the [repository created by Dr Mingqiang Ning](https://github.com/freepoet/SCTD)
